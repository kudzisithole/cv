        <p><em>Founder and Chairman of ZimFind.</em></p>
        <p>Kudzai Sithole is a telecomminications engineer and the current chairman of ZimFind. Zimfind was founded by him in late 2020 and
          went on to be a fully fledged startup in 2021 when he teamed up with his childhood friend and current CEO of the company.
          the company went on to become more than a project for the pair when econet started funding the project. most of the companie
          listed at the time were small scale companies with the more established companies in the country joining after the initial investment
          coming from Econet. Kudzai is considered non religious with many claiming he is a spiritual person who is dedicated on self realisation. he started a web blog on self realisation
          and self discovery when he finished his web development bootcamp on udemy. he is considered one of the most influencial young
          zimbabweans in that country though he is a very private person and rarely makes any public appearences. his networth is relatively
          unknown with many suggesting could be in the tens of millions. Forbes Africa is reportedly doing a piece on him suggesting
          that there could be a sneak peak into his life and finances. With him being the major shareholder of ZimFind its safe to say
          young chairman is relatively wealthy.
